ATS Application

This application takes in a job description and a PDF resume.
It converts the PDF to an image and then uses Google Gemini Pro
to generate a response based on the job description and the resume.

The application has three modes:
1. Detailed evaluation of the resume against the job description.
2. Practical advice on how the candidate can improve their skills.
3. Match percentage indicating how well the resume aligns with the job description.

The application uses the following functions:
- get_gemini_response: takes in the job description, the resume (as an image), and a prompt, and returns the response from Google Gemini Pro.
- input_pdf_setup: takes in a PDF file and converts it to an image.
